            <p>Read our <a href="https://github.com/manuel-freire/ac2/wiki/Quickstart">Quickstart Guide</a>
                for initial steps
            </p>
            <p>Submissions that are very similar will compress together much more than submissions that are very
                different.
            </p>
            <p>This test uses tokenized sources, and therefore ignores whitespace, comments, and identifier names
                when comparing source-code. It is very robust to a wide range of other manipulations,
                and is therefore used as a default test.
            </p>
            <p>This test compares the size of compressing the sources of each submission separately vs.
                compressing both together,
                using
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)">Zip</a>
                as a compressor. See the wikipedia
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_compression_distance">article on NCD</a>

        <testname>Token counting test</testname>
        <helpcontent>
            <p>Submissions that have the same distribution of tokens are more similar than those that do not.
            </p>
            <p>This test uses tokenized sources, and therefore ignores whitespace, comments, and identifier names
                when comparing source-code. It is also immune to code refactoring that does not change the total amounts
                of each type of token.
            </p>
            <p>This test calculates the scalar product of the normalized token-vectors for two submissions.
                It is based on the cosine similarity test used in information retrieval.
